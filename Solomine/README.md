## Design Philosophy

Solomine features a **hacker terminal / retro command-line aesthetic** with:

- Pure black backgrounds (#000000)
- Neon green accents (#00FF41) for CTAs and highlights
- Amber/orange (#FFB800) for secondary actions
- Monospace fonts (Menlo) throughout the entire app
- Sharp, boxy UI elements with minimal corner radius
- Terminal-style loading indicators and empty states
- Dark mode only (no light mode option)
- NO emojis - clean initials-based avatars only

2. Tap "SIGN IN WITH X" → simulated X OAuth (1 sec)
3. RoleSelectionView appears → choose "I Build" or "I Hire"
4. Enter main app with full access

## Next Steps

### Required for Production
- [ ] Backend API for payment processing
- [ ] Real authentication system
- [ ] Database for users, gigs, messages
- [ ] Push notifications
- [ ] File upload for portfolio images
- [ ] Escrow system for payments
- [ ] Review/rating system after project completion

### Nice to Have
- [ ] Onboarding flow
- [ ] Advanced search/filters
- [ ] In-app messaging with real-time
- [ ] Video call integration
- [ ] Contract templates
- [ ] Time tracking
- [ ] Invoice generation

## Notes

This is an MVP focused on design and core user flow. The Apple Pay integration is frontend-complete but requires backend implementation for production use. All emoji references have been removed and replaced with a clean, terminal-aesthetic avatar system.
