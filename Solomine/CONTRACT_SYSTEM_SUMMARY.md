## 🔄 Modified Files

### **ViewsFreelancerDashboardView.swift**
Updated the Contracts tab to use the new `BuilderContractsView()` instead of the old placeholder.

case .activeContracts:
    BuilderContractsView()  // ← New!
```

### **PaymentManager.swift**
Added contract-specific payment methods:

```swift
// New method for contract payments
func createContractPaymentRequest(
    contract: Contract,
    milestone: Milestone? = nil
) -> PKPaymentRequest

// New method to process contract payments
func processContractPayment(
    contract: Contract,
    milestone: Milestone? = nil,
    completion: @escaping (Result<PKPaymentToken, Error>) -> Void
)
```

## 💡 Key Features

## 📱 Apple Pay Setup

### Required (Production):

1. **Apple Developer Account**
   - Enable Apple Pay capability
   - Create merchant identifier: `merchant.com.solomine.payments`
   - Configure certificates

2. **Xcode Project**
   - Add Apple Pay entitlement

3. **Backend Integration**
   - Implement payment processing endpoints
   - Handle Apple Pay tokens
   - Process charges via Stripe/etc.

### Current State:

✅ UI and flow complete
✅ Apple Pay integration ready
⚠️ Uses placeholder merchant ID
⚠️ Needs backend API implementation

## 🔐 Security Features

- ✅ Apple Pay tokenization (no card storage)
- ✅ Biometric authentication required
- ✅ 3D Secure for card transactions
- ✅ Secure payment links with unique IDs
- ✅ Payment token sent to backend only
- ✅ No sensitive data in app

## 📊 Contract Lifecycle

```
1. Draft → Builder creates contract
    ↓
2. Pending Signature → Sent to client
    ↓
3. Payment → Client pays via Apple Pay
    ↓
4. Active → Work in progress
    ↓
5. Milestones → Complete and request payment
    ↓
6. Completed → All work done and paid
```

## 🎨 UI Components

All views follow your existing design system:
- Terminal-style cards (`terminalCard()`)
- Consistent spacing (`Theme.Spacing.*`)
- Typography (`Theme.Typography.*`)
- Color scheme (`Theme.Colors.*`)
- Corner radius (`Theme.CornerRadius.*`)

## ✅ What Works Now

- ✅ Create contracts with all fields
- ✅ Configure payment structures
- ✅ Generate payment links
- ✅ Display contracts list
- ✅ Filter contracts by status
- ✅ Track milestone progress
- ✅ Apple Pay integration (UI and flow)
- ✅ Payment breakdown calculations
- ✅ Status management
- ✅ Client payment interface

## ⚠️ What Needs Backend

- [ ] Save contracts to database
- [ ] Send payment request notifications
- [ ] Process Apple Pay tokens
- [ ] Charge customer payment methods
- [ ] Transfer funds to builders
- [ ] Hold escrow for milestone contracts
- [ ] Update contract status after payment
- [ ] Send email notifications
- [ ] Generate contract PDFs

## 🧪 Testing

You can test the UI flow now:

1. Run the app in simulator
2. Navigate to Builder Dashboard → Contracts tab
3. Tap "Create Contract"
4. Fill out the form
5. Create a contract
6. View contract details
7. See payment link generation

**Note:** Apple Pay won't work in simulator, but you can see the UI and flow.

## 📝 Next Steps

### Immediate:

1. **Update Merchant ID**
   - Replace placeholder in `PaymentManager.swift`
   - Use your production merchant ID

2. **Backend APIs**
   - Implement contract CRUD endpoints
   - Add payment processing endpoint
   - Set up webhooks

3. **Payment Processor**
   - Integrate Stripe (or similar)
   - Configure webhook handlers
   - Set up payout system

### Future:

- Contract templates
- Auto-release after X days
- Dispute resolution workflow
- Contract signing with e-signatures
- Invoice generation
- Tax reporting
