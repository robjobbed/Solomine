# Marketplace System

## Overview

Solomine features a **dual marketplace system** that automatically adapts based on user role:

- **Builders** see the **Gig Marketplace** - Browse and apply for available gigs
- **Hirers** see the **Builder Marketplace** - Find and hire available builders

Both marketplaces are designed to feel **live and dynamic**, creating urgency and excitement around new opportunities.

    let id: UUID
    let hirerId: UUID
    let hirerName: String
    let hirerHandle: String
    var title: String
    var description: String
    var requirements: [String]
    var budget: Double
    var estimatedHours: Int

    var urgency: GigUrgency
    var postedDate: Date
    var applicants: Int
}
```

### GigUrgency
```swift
enum GigUrgency: String {

    case flexible = "FLEXIBLE" // Low pressure
}
```

## User Experience

### The "Live Marketplace" Feel

#### Why It Works
1. **Auto-refresh** - New gigs appear automatically
2. **Time indicators** - "JUST NOW" creates urgency
3. **Applicant counts** - Shows competition
4. **Urgency badges** - Visual priority system
5. **Pulse animation** - Green dot indicates live updates
6. **Dynamic sorting** - Find best opportunities fast

#### Psychology
- **FOMO (Fear of Missing Out)** - Timestamps and urgency badges
- **Competition** - Applicant counts make builders act fast
- **Transparency** - Clear budgets and time estimates
- **Autonomy** - Builders propose their own rates
- **Social Proof** - X verification and follower counts

## Integration Points

### With AuthenticationManager
```swift
@EnvironmentObject var authManager: AuthenticationManager

// In ExploreView
if currentUser.role == .builder {
    GigMarketplaceView()
} else {
    BuilderMarketplaceView()
}
```

### With User Model
```swift
struct User {
    var role: UserRole? // .builder or .hirer
    var freelancerProfile: FreelancerProfile?
}
```

## Design System Compliance

All views follow your terminal/cyberpunk theme:

- **Colors**: `Theme.Colors.accent`, `.background`, `.surface`, etc.
- **Typography**: `Theme.Typography.h1`, `.body`, `.caption`, etc.
- **Spacing**: `Theme.Spacing.sm`, `.md`, `.lg`, etc.
- **Animations**: `FadeInView`, `SlideInView`, `AnimatedCard`
- **Cards**: `.terminalCard()` modifier
- **Borders**: `Theme.BorderWidth.thin`, `Theme.CornerRadius.medium`

---

## Testing

### Preview Both Marketplaces
```swift
#Preview("Builder Marketplace (Hirers)") {
    NavigationStack {
        BuilderMarketplaceView()
    }
}

#Preview("Gig Marketplace (Builders)") {
    NavigationStack {
        GigMarketplaceView()
    }
}
```

### Test Scenarios
1. **Empty state** - Clear filters to see all gigs
2. **Filtering** - Select different categories
3. **Sorting** - Try all sort options
4. **Application flow** - Fill out application form
5. **Post gig** - Create new gig listing
6. **Auto-refresh** - Watch for new gigs appearing

---

## Performance Notes

### Auto-Refresh Timer
- Runs every 15-30 seconds (randomized)
- Adds one new gig per cycle
- Keeps only most recent 50 gigs
- Stops when view is dismissed

### Memory Management
```swift
deinit {
    refreshTimer?.invalidate()
}
```

## Accessibility

- All buttons have proper labels
- Text is readable at all sizes
- Color contrast meets WCAG standards
- VoiceOver compatible
- Dynamic Type support through Theme.Typography
